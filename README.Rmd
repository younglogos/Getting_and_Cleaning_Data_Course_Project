# How the script works
## Getting data set
1. Create two directories called "input" and "output" to store the raw data set and tidy data set
2. Using download.file() to fetch the data set into "input" directory
3. Using unzip() to view the file names and path
4. Read the files needed to analyse after we know which files contained in the "input" directory
5. Combine X_train, y_train and subject_train in a "dataTrain" data frame, and X_test, y_test and subject_test in a "testTrain" data frame
6. Rename the colume names of new data frames created in step 5 according to the "feature" data set

## Converting raw data into tidy data
1. Using rbind to merge "dataTrain" and "dataTestâ€œ into a new data set
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and stanard deviation for each measurement by regular expression
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activity in the data set created in step 1
4. Label the data set with descriptive names:
    i)   prefix t is replaced by time
    ii)  Acc is replaced by Accelerometer
    iii) Gyro is replaced by Gyroscope
    iv)  prefix f is replaced by frequency
    v)   Mag is replaced by Magnitude
    vi)  BodyBody is replaced by Body
5. Created a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the data set in last step

# Introduction
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers, who were 19 to 48 years old. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, researchers captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
